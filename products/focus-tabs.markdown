## What's Focus Tabs?

`Focus Tabs` is a google chrome extension to help you focus while working on your task. Often times it's not about having more time, but about having less distraction. Working with more focus allow you to finish your task faster.

Aside from helping you to focus more, `Focus Tabs` also encourage you to divide your big task into smaller ones. Small task is more easier to start and easier to finish. Imagine you want to write the whole novel in one sit, it's impossible. You make smaller to make the whole novel.

You will often find term `goal` and `tasks` while using `Focus Tabs`. `Goal` is to make novel, and `tasks` is all smaller actions to make it happen.

## Features
