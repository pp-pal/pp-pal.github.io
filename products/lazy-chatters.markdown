## What's Lazy Chatters?

`Lazy Chatters` google chrome extension will send you a `notification` when someone `mention you in a Twitch chat`. It's not rare for Twitch chatters (yes you) to multi tasking while watching streamer(s). Watching more than one stream is a norm too. So, watch as many streamers as you can!

Watch out on your top right for our notification.

Another culture is `Twitch copy pasta`. Be ready for the moment. Add `shortcut` for your pasta so you don't miss.

## Features

### Twitch mention notification

`Lazy Chatters` will send notification when someone mention you on Twitch chat. As long as you are watching any streams, you will get notifications. `If you close the tab, you won't get notification`.

Are you watching while working? Don't worry, you can turn off the notification.
